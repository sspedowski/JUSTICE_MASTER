### What
- Upgrade Python downloader to requests-based session with retries/backoff.
- HTML sniff + OneDrive/SharePoint `?download=1` fallback.
- Creates downloads/EVIDENCE.txt with "THIS IS EVIDENCE".
- Add requirements.txt (requests>=2.32.0).

### Why
- Folder/share pages and auth redirects were breaking unattended downloads.

### How to test
```
python download_exhibits.py --urls "<direct-file-zip-url>"
```
Expect: downloads/<file> saved and downloads/EVIDENCE.txt present.

### Notes
- PowerShell and Bash variants already hardened; parity retained.
