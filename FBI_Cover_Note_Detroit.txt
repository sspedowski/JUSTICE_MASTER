Subject: Evidence package — potential alteration of official records (Barry County CPS)

Dear Detroit Field Office,

I am submitting an evidence package documenting potential alteration of official records in a Barry County CPS case impacting my sons. The package includes a manifest with SHA-256 checksums and chain-of-custody notes. A secure download link is included; I can also transfer via a method your office prefers (SFTP/AFT/Box).

Highlights:
• Worker-authored edits/verifications dated Nov 2020 that changed the case history
• Consolidation of multiple 2020 intakes under an active investigation ID
• Retrospective medical contact entry (SANE) and a referral chain (CTAC / Battle Creek) later echoed in CPS history
• Bates-stamped exhibits with page ranges, sworn statement, and manifest

Package details:
