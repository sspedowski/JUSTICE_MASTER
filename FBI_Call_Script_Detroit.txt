Hello, my name is Stephanie Spedowski. I’m calling about submitting an evidence package regarding potential alteration of official CPS records in Barry County, Michigan, involving my two sons.

I have:
• A Bates-stamped exhibit set, sworn statement, and a manifest with SHA-256 checksums
• A chain-of-custody note
• A secure OneDrive link for the ZIP (direct download)

Could you please advise on the preferred secure transfer method (SFTP/AFT/Box) and the appropriate unit or agent to receive it? I can also send a brief cover note by email right now.

My contact is 616-333-0486 and godspathtojustice@gmail.com. Thank you.
