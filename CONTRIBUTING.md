# Contributing to Justice_Master

Thank you for contributing. This document contains minimal guidelines to keep commits, branches, and contributions consistent.

Commit messages

- Prefix conventional type when helpful: chore:, feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, refactor:, style:
- Provide a longer description in the body when the change needs context.

Branching

- Create feature branches from `main` named `feat/<short-desc>` or `fix/<short-desc>`.
- Keep pull requests focused and small.

Pull requests

- Include a short description of the change and any manual verification steps.
- Ensure tests pass (if relevant) before requesting review.
