# PR: Batch 03 pipeline — import Top-10 + generator hardening + docs

## Why

* Normalize Top-10 inputs into `99_Master_Index.csv` and produce a printable **MasterFile_Batch_03.pdf** (✅ rows only).
* Reduce human error with Excel-free ingestion and scripted PDF generation.
* Capture run steps in repo docs for repeatability.

## What changed

* **CSV/Index**

  * Imported Top-10 spreadsheet rows → `99_Master_Index.csv` (deduped).
* **Scripts**

  * `import_user_xlsx.py` (new): normalize user XLSX → master columns.
  * `extract_top10_from_docx.py` (hardened): more tolerant DOCX parsing.
  * `generate_batch_pdf.py` (hardened): robust include filtering + formatting.
  * `top10_pipeline.ps1` (wrapper already in repo): venv + ingest + build.
* **Artifacts**

  * Built `02_Batches/Batch_03/MasterFile_Batch_03.pdf`.
* **Repo hygiene**

  * Removed stray `.bak` files.
  * Lint-clean run sheets in `02_Batches/Batch_03/`.

## How I tested

* Ran wrapper: `.\top10_pipeline.ps1 -Batch 03`
* Verified PDF exists and non-zero size: `02_Batches/Batch_03/MasterFile_Batch_03.pdf`
* Verified tail of `99_Master_Index.csv` shows Batch 03 rows with `✅ Include`.

## Risks & mitigations

* **Duplicate rows** in master CSV if re-ingesting: mitigated by reviewing diff before commit.
* **Missing ✅ rows** → PDF empty: documented quick helper to set `✅ Include` then re-run.
* **Large files not LFS-tracked**: `.gitattributes` patterns in place; audit script available.

## Follow-ups (separate PRs welcome)

* CI: lint Markdown + run a minimal PDF smoke test.
* Pre-commit hooks for MD and CSV end-of-line.
* Optional: `prefill_summaries_from_md.py` to sync MD → CSV summaries.

### Checklist

* [x] `99_Master_Index.csv` contains Batch 03 rows
* [x] At least one row marked `✅ Include`
* [x] `MasterFile_Batch_03.pdf` present and readable
* [x] No `.bak` files tracked
